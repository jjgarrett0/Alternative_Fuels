# Alternative_Fuels

I'll be exploring Location Data information for Biofuels in the US. This will hopefully lead to an easier way to look up this information. The current web pages or mobile apps that contain this information aren't the easiest to use. My hope is that after exploring this data I can create something that will make it easy for biofuel users to find the infromation they need.
